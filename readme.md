## Key Components

- **Scenes**: Multiple Unity scenes for different game states (Intro, Levels, Game Over, etc.).
- **Scripts**: Core C# scripts for game logic, including ball and paddle behavior, game management, and UI controls.
- **Prefabs**: Reusable game objects, such as bricks.
- **Physics**: Custom physics materials for 2D interactions.
- **Sound**: Background music, sound effects, and character voice clips.
- **Sprites**: Visual assets for backgrounds, UI, characters, and game elements.

## Getting Started

1. Open `Ricochet.sln` or the project folder in Unity Hub.
2. Make sure all assets are imported and scripts are compiled.
3. Open any scene from the `Assets/Scenes` folder to start playing or editing.

## Credits
